I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Khumbu](https://www.khumbu.ai/), where I leverage cutting-edge AI models for drug discovery with an initial focus on diabetes. I recently completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/), complemented by research on PET foundation models at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).

My research focuses on applying deep learning and medical imaging analysis to solve significant healthcare challenges. During my PhD, I developed innovative approaches for high-resolution Organ-on-Chip imaging, interpreted tau-PET brain scans for neurodegenerative diseases, and advanced CT-free total-body PET segmentation. My visiting research position at the [Center for Advanced Medical Computing and Analysis (CAMCA)](https://camca.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School allowed me to work on foundational models for PET/CT imaging under the supervision of Dr. Quanzheng Li.

I hold a Master's degree in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence from the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/), where I specialized in computer-aided medical procedures, computer vision, and deep learning. I also completed an honors degree in Technology Management at the [Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM)](https://www.cdtm.de/), combining technical expertise with entrepreneurial skills.

Previously, I worked on deepfake detection at TUM's Visual Computing Group in collaboration with the AI Foundation, and gained industry experience as a Data Science Trainer at Celonis, where I delivered hands-on workshops across Europe. I am passionate about translating research into practical applications that improve patient care and diagnostic techniques.
